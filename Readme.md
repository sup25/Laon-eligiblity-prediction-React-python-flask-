# Loan eligibility prediction using logistic regression

Loan eligibility prediction using logistic regression is a statistical method that predicts whether a borrower will be approved or denied for a loan based on their financial and personal information.\
Logistic regression is a type of binary classification algorithm that can model the probability of the binary outcome (approved or denied) based on a set of predictor variables.\
The model is trained and tested on a historical dataset of loan applications, and once trained and tested, it can be used to predict the likelihood of loan approval for new loan applications.\
Logistic regression is effective for loan eligibility prediction because it can handle both categorical and continuous predictor variables, and it can provide insights into the factors that influence loan approval decisions.
